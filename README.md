# Technical Fundamentals of Bitcoin

This repository documents my progress and learning in the **Technical Fundamentals of Bitcoin** course, offered by [Librería de Satoshi](https://github.com/LibreriadeSatoshi).

My intention is to record all the key concepts from the course in an accessible format and share my notes and research primarily with the Spanish-speaking community. I hope it can serve as a useful resource for other students and Bitcoin enthusiasts. All contributions are welcome.

## How is this repository organized?

The course content is organized by topics, each with its own Markdown file inside the `src/` directory.  
Each file contains explanations, references, graphics, examples, and in some cases, timelines or conceptual diagrams.
